<meta name="description" content="Configuring Alexa Skills with Bespoken Proxy" />

In order to leverage the bst proxy functionality, you must configure your skill from the Amazon Developer Console to point to the bst proxy server.

## Configure your Skill Endpoint ###

When you run the bst proxy command, you will see a URL output:

```bash
$ bst proxy lambda index.js
BST: v1.0.4  Node: v4.3.2

Your public URL for accessing your local service:
https://determined-rice.bespoken.link
```

From your [Skill's list](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list), select an existing skill to edit or create a new one.  Navigate to the Configuration step and update the HTTPS endpoint to the one provided by the proxy command.

Make sure Account linking is set to "No" and on the SSL Certificate step select "My development endpoint is a subdomain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority".

__ Note__ To help generate your configuration URL, you can also use [bst proxy urlgen](/en/latest/commands/proxy#bst-proxy-urlgen)

## Path Component for proxy http

When using bst proxy http for local servers running on a specific port, you need to make sure your path components are correct.

For example, when you run the bst proxy http command:

```bash
$ bst proxy http 9999
BST: v1.0.4  Node: v4.3.2

Your public URL for accessing your local service:
https://determined-rice.bespoken.link
```

If your local server listens on path `/alexa-skill`, you need to update the URL with your path before configuring your Skill.

```
Your public URL for accessing your local service:
https://determined-rice.bespoken.link/alexa-skill
```
